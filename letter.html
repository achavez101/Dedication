        <h3 style="padding-left: 15px;">Dear Ellie Elle,</h3>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 225px;">
            I am happy to call you my best friend. You  have made a significant difference in my life. One in which I may not be able to fully encapsulate all of the details of this friendship, but it has been amazing. I have learned so much with you and only want to keep learning more. I want to thank you for being patient with me and for letting me learn along the way how to treat you. I know that there have been times in which I've made insensitive comments and that has not been good for either of us, but I'm thankful that you have always given me a chance to redeem those negative behaviors. There would be no other place I want to be than with you. You are super amazing and you mean a ton to me. 
            Something really nice is that every time there is some sort of argument now or some sort of issue, I know that everything will be okay. I used to get so scared that things would end between us, but for some time now, there's been a sense of security. I thank you for loving me the way you have. I thank you for being here, the way you have. I thank you for always lending a hand to me. I thank you for constantly reminding me that it's gonna be okay even when it doesn't feel that way. I thank you for the friend that you have been to me. I don't know where I'd be today if it wasn't for you, but I know where I am because of you. Because of you, I feel more free everyday. Because of you, I experience many laughs. Because of you, I experience more happiness on my day to day life. Call that using you, but I just love you so purely. 
        </h3>
