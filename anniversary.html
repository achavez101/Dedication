            <h3>I'm going to take the time to give you a couple of dates in which only a few are really outlined in the pictures.</h3>
            <h3>The first significant date that comes to mind was the day I first told you that you were my friend and it all began on December 23rd, 2018</h3>
            <h3>The second date I want to outline is when you first said I love you to me and that date was February 13th, 2019</h3>
            <h3>Seems like it took a couple of tries, but I went on to reciprocrate it on February 15th, 2019</h3>
            <h3>It wasn't very common for those words to come out of my mouth so it really had to mean something</h3>
            <h3>The next one is March 16th, 2019 when I first called you my best friend. I know that at the moment, you didn't say it back but I saw how much it meant to you and that meant the world to me</h3>
            <h3>Our friendship did not stop there though, we then went on to become closer</h3>
            <h3>On October 2nd, 2021 we were able to meet for the first time in person</h3>
            <h3>Now we are here on December 23rd, 2021 and it's been great, those are my words, it's been great</h3>
